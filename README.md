## Overview

In this assignment, students consolidate their learning in the Machine Learning Concepts unit by creating a practical solution for a real-world, industry-based machine learning problem. The task involves data understanding, exploration, cleaning, and preparation, as well as machine learning model selection, tuning, fitting, evaluation, and analysis.

## Key Tasks

- **Obtaining and Exploring the Dataset:**
  - Utilize the Car Sale Adverts dataset provided by AutoTrader.
  - Explore the dataset for information on vehicles, including brand, type, color, mileage, and selling price.

- **Machine Learning Tasks to Perform:**
  1. **Data/Domain Understanding and Exploration:**
     - Load and analyze the data, identify features, and understand the distribution of data.

  2. **Data Processing for Machine Learning:**
     - Handle noise, missing values, and outliers.
     - Reshape and engineer features for machine learning purposes.

  3. **Model Building:**
     - Choose suitable regression algorithms.
     - Fit and tune models using techniques such as grid-search.

  4. **Model Evaluation and Analysis:**
     - Evaluate models using cross-validation.
     - Analyze actual vs predicted plots and gain insights based on feature importance.

## Deliverables

Students are expected to produce a brief, structured report containing code snippets and explanations. Additionally, a single fully-documented, reproducible Python notebook serves as the foundation for the report.

## Dataset Information

- The dataset is provided by AutoTrader and is available as a .csv file with approximately 400K rows.

## Machine Learning Tasks

To address the main task of building a regression model for price prediction, implement and run the following tasks:
- Data/Domain Understanding and Exploration
- Data Processing for Machine Learning
- Model Building
- Model Evaluation and Analysis
