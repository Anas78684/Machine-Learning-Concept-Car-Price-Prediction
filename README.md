# Project Overview
This repository showcases my implementation of the Machine Learning Concepts unit assignment, focusing on a real-world problem - predicting car sale advert prices. Leveraging a dataset provided by AutoTrader, a prominent industry partner, I have employed various machine learning tasks to construct a robust regression model.
# Key Tasks
- **Dataset Exploration**
Loaded the dataset and conducted initial observations.
Ensured correct parsing of data.
Identified both quantitative and qualitative features.
Analyzed data distributions to grasp key insights.
Selected relevant predictors for further analysis.
- **Data Preprocessing**
Detected and handled noise, missing values, and outliers.
Engineered features to enhance model performance.
Applied categorical encoding and rescaling for data preparation.
Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets for comprehensive evaluation.
- **Model Building**
Explored and selected suitable regression algorithms.
Utilized grid-search to fine-tune models.
Ranked and selected models based on evaluation metrics and balancing under/overfitting.
- **Model Evaluation and Analysis**
Employed cross-validation to assess model performance.
Generated actual vs predicted plots for visual insights.
Analyzed feature importance for better understanding.
Investigated individual predictions and distribution of scores/losses.
Provided brief discussions on the structure of interpretable models.
# Deliverables
Presented a concise and structured report with code snippets and explanations.
Submitted a fully-documented, reproducible Python notebook, serving as the basis for the report.
# Important Note
This work adheres to the dataset usage guidelines outlined by AutoTrader, ensuring compliance with ethical considerations. The dataset, provided by AutoTrader, is not redistributed.
